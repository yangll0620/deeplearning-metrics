## Brief Description

Cohen's kappa coefficient (κ) is a statistic which measures inter-rater agreement for qualitative (categorical) items. It is generally thought to be a more robust measure than simple percent agreement calculation, as κ takes into account the possibility of the agreement occurring by chance. (From Wikepedia)
